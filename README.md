## Why?

Canvas courses can disappear after a semester ends. Downloading files one at a time is tedious when you have hundreds across multiple courses, and existing tools all need API tokens or Python scripts. This extension uses your existing session cookies, so there's nothing to configure.

Having a local copy of your course materials also means you can feed them into AI tools — load everything into NotebookLM for study sessions, use an AI agent to help you review or summarize readings, or build a searchable knowledge base from an entire semester's worth of content.

If you teach, it doubles as an end-of-term archiving tool: it detects your instructor role and pulls in everything students can't see — every submission, the full gradebook, quiz results, and threaded discussions.

## Features

- Download everything from a single course, or select multiple courses from your dashboard
- Pick between active and past courses, grouped by term, with search filtering
- Bundle each course into a single `.zip` file instead of loose folders
- Incremental mode skips files you've already downloaded on previous runs
- Export your grades (and class averages!) as a CSV with assignment names, due dates, points, scores, and letter grades
- Export pages, assignments, announcements, and discussions as either HTML or Markdown
- Automatically detects whether you're a **student or teacher/TA** in each course and exports accordingly — no extra setup
- **Teacher mode:** download every student's submission (all attempts, in per-student folders), with a per-assignment grades CSV
- **Teacher mode:** full gradebook and student roster CSVs, complete threaded discussions, and rubric scores plus comments
- **Quizzes:** answer keys with per-student scores for teachers; your own score and answers as a student
- Filter out video files or cap the maximum file size to keep archives lean
- Cross-reference rewriting: links between exported pages, assignments, and files become relative paths so you can browse the course offline without dead Canvas links
- Pulls in pages that only appear inside Modules, plus their embedded slides / PDFs
- Finds files embedded in assignments, pages, announcements, and discussions that don't appear in the file browser
- Saves into organized subfolders per course with your original Canvas folder structure preserved
- Four built-in presets (Full Archive, Files Only, Text Only, Linked Only) plus custom configuration
- Configurable download throttling, file conflict handling, and folder prefix
- Configurable Canvas domain allowlist with optional global subdomain matching
- Keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+D</kbd> (Mac: <kbd>Cmd+Shift+D</kbd>)
- Works with any Canvas instance, including self-hosted installations on custom domains
- No API tokens needed. Runs entirely in your browser with nothing sent to external servers

### Settings

Open settings from the extension popup or your browser's extension options page. Settings are organized into four tabs: **Content**, **Downloads**, **Format**, and **Filters**.

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Content types | Toggle what to export, split into two groups — *Course content*: files, pages, assignments, syllabus, modules, announcements, linked/extracted files; *Student data & grades*: student submissions, discussions, grades, quizzes |
| Presets | Quick-select common combos: Full Archive, Files Only, Text Content Only, Linked Files Only |
| File conflict handling | Choose Rename (add a number suffix) or Overwrite when a file already exists |
| Download throttle | Delay between downloads in milliseconds (default 250, range 50–5000) |
| Allowed Canvas domains | Domain allowlist controlling where the extension can run (multiple entries supported) |
| Allow subdomains | Global toggle to include subdomains for every allowlisted domain (off by default) |
| Folder prefix | Custom string prepended to all download paths |
| ZIP bundling | Bundle each course into a single `.zip` file (on by default; falls back to loose files above ~1.5 GB) |
| Incremental mode | Track what's been downloaded per course and skip those files next time |
| Export format | HTML (default) or Markdown — Markdown is best for Obsidian, Notion, or LLM ingestion |
| Filters | Exclude video files (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, …) and/or cap the maximum file size in MB |

## Supported content

| Content type | What gets downloaded |
| --- | --- |
| Files | All files from the course file browser, preserving the original folder hierarchy |
| Pages | Every wiki page saved as an HTML (or Markdown) file |
| Assignments | Each assignment with its description, due date, and rubric definition |
| Announcements | Course announcements with dates |
| Discussions | Discussion topics. Teachers/TAs get the full threaded replies and reply attachments; students get the opening post |
| Modules | Module structure overview plus any files referenced within modules |
| Syllabus | The course syllabus |
| Grades | Students get a personal `Grades.csv` (your scores plus class Low/Lower-quartile/Median/Mean/Upper-quartile/High stats). Teachers/TAs get a full `Gradebook.csv` (every student × assignment) and a `Students.csv` roster |
| Student submissions | *Teacher/TA:* every student's work for each assignment — all attempts, organized as `Submissions/<Assignment>/<Student>/`, with a per-assignment `_grades.csv` and rubric feedback. *Student:* your own submissions and attempt history |
| Quizzes | Quiz metadata and description for everyone. *Teacher/TA:* the question bank with answer key plus a per-student score table and `_grades.csv`. *Student:* your score and (when the instructor left responses visible) your answered questions |
| Linked files | Files embedded in page/assignment/announcement/discussion HTML that don't appear in the file browser, including inline images |

Each export also includes a `manifest.json` with metadata: export date, file counts per type, source URL, and extension version.

└── manifest.json
```

The teacher-only entries (`Submissions/`, `Gradebook.csv`, `Students.csv`, the quiz answer keys, full discussion threads) only appear when you have an instructor, TA, or designer role in the course. Student exports omit them.

In ZIP mode, the same structure is bundled into a single `Course Name.zip`. In Markdown export mode, all generated documents end in `.md` instead of `.html` and the `styles.css` file is omitted.

## How it works

The extension runs only on Canvas domains that you explicitly allow in Settings. On allowed domains, it detects Canvas pages (using domain and Canvas-specific DOM signals) and calls the Canvas REST API with your existing session cookies, following pagination via RFC 5988 Link headers.

It also checks your enrollment in the course. When you have a teacher, TA, or designer role, it unlocks the instructor-only endpoints (student submissions, full discussion threads, the gradebook, quiz answer keys) — these are skipped entirely for students, so a student export only ever contains your own data.

Beyond the normal file list, it parses HTML content from pages, assignments, announcements, and discussions to extract linked files and inline images that aren't in the file browser, saving them under `Extracted_Files/`. Files get queued in the background service worker, which downloads them sequentially with configurable throttling. Failed downloads are retried with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts) and can be retried manually from the progress panel.

## Permissions

The content script is injected only on domains you configure in the settings allowlist (for example `canvas.university.edu` or `school.instructure.com`). By default matching is exact-host only; you can optionally enable a global setting to include subdomains for all allowlisted domains. Elevated host permissions remain scoped to `*://*.instructure.com/*`, and self-hosted instances work when their domains are allowlisted.

For the full privacy policy, see [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Known limitations

- Content hosted by third-party LTI tools (Turnitin, Panopto, external videos) lives outside Canvas and can't be downloaded
- You must be logged into Canvas. There's no API-token or headless mode
- Pages, assignments, announcements, and discussions are saved as HTML summaries, not pixel-perfect copies of the Canvas layout
- Heavily customized Canvas themes may affect button placement or page detection
- Courses with hundreds of files will take a few minutes. The throttle setting helps balance speed against browser download limits
- Teacher exports that include every student's submission can be large and slow; above ~1.5 GB, ZIP bundling automatically falls back to individual file downloads
- Windows paths are truncated to stay under the 260-character limit, which can shorten long filenames

## Troubleshooting

**"Not on a Canvas page"** — The extension didn't detect Canvas on the current page. Make sure you're on a page with Canvas navigation elements. On self-hosted instances with heavy theme customizations, detection can fail. File an issue with details about your Canvas URL.

**Course selector is empty** — No courses came back from the API. Try the **Past Courses** tab for completed semesters. Some institutions restrict API access for certain enrollment roles.

**Downloads blocked by browser** — Browsers may block bulk downloads the first time. Click **Allow** when prompted. If downloads are timing out, lower the throttle value in settings.

**Some files are missing** — Files in restricted areas or behind additional permission checks may not be accessible through the API. Files hosted by external LTI tools won't be captured. Check the browser console for specific errors.

**Firefox add-on expired** — Firefox temporary add-ons only last until browser restart. Reload from `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
