# Privacy Policy — Canvas Course Downloader

**Last updated:** March 14, 2026

## Overview

Canvas Course Downloader is a free, open-source browser extension. This policy explains what data the extension accesses and how it's handled.

## Data Collection

**Canvas Course Downloader does not collect, store, transmit, or share any user data.** The extension does not use analytics, tracking, cookies, or any form of telemetry.

## How the Extension Works

- The extension runs entirely in your browser.
- When you choose to download course content, it communicates **only** with the Canvas LMS server you are currently logged into, using your existing browser session.
- Downloaded files are saved directly to your computer via your browser's built-in download manager.
- No data is ever sent to the extension developer, any third-party server, or any external service.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following browser permissions:

| Permission | Why it's needed |
|---|---|
| `activeTab` | To communicate with the content script on the current tab |
| `downloads` | To save course files to your computer |
| `notifications` | To notify you when a download batch finishes |
| `storage` | To save your settings and track which files have been downloaded in incremental mode |
| `scripting` | Registers and injects the content scripts only on user-allowlisted Canvas domains |
| Content script (dynamic allowlist) | Runs only on domains you configure in settings. Exact-host matching is default; optional global subdomain matching can be enabled |
| Host permissions (`*://*.instructure.com/*`) | Elevated access for Instructure-hosted Canvas instances. On self-hosted instances the extension works through same-origin requests from the page you're already on |
| `declarativeNetRequest` | Allows the extension to declare rules that modify network responses. Used solely to add a CORS header to responses from Canvas's file CDN (`canvas-user-content.com`), which is required for the extension to read file bytes when building ZIP archives |
| Host permissions (`*://*.canvas-user-content.com/*`) | Canvas stores uploaded files on this CDN domain. This permission is required for the CORS rule above to be permitted to apply to responses from that domain |

## Third-Party Services

The extension does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services.
